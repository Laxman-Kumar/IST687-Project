# Customer Churn in Airline Industry

South East Airlines is currently suffering from customer churn, owing to poor customer experience and customer dissatisfaction. The customer satisfaction is identified through a likelihood to recommendation score filled in by the customer in their survey. This likelihood to recommend score is used to tag a customer as a Promoter, Detractor or Passive. The Net Promoter Score (NPS) is then measured as the difference between % of Promoters and % Detractors. Detractors are the customers who are most likely to churn and may cause more customers to churn by spreading negative reviews, whereas Promoters on the other hand may even bring in more customers by spreading positive reviews.

Currently, the airline has 14 partner airlines of which 2 of the airlines have a negative NPS which means that, they have more Detractors than Promoters. The goal of the project is to provide actionable insights and recommendations, that will help increase their NPS.
Moreover, South East Airlines needs help in deciding which partners to keep, which partners to drop and which regional airlines should become their new partners.

The Dataset received contains 10,282 customer surveys that captures several customer and flight attributes along with the likelihood to recommend score provided by each customer.
